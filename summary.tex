\section{Security Hardening and Architectural Evolution}
Following a deep architectural review performed by the integrated Gemini Pro AI, \texttt{spip} has undergone significant evolution to resolve critical security and design flaws.

\section{Implemented Security Fixes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Shell Injection Prevention}: Implemented a universal \texttt{quote\_arg} sanitizer that escapes backslashes, double quotes, and dollar signs. This is now enforced on every \texttt{std::system} and \texttt{popen} call.
    \item \textbf{Safe Wheel Extraction}: Replaced the legacy \texttt{unzip} command with a Python-based \texttt{safe\_extract.py} helper. This script explicitly validates ZIP member paths to prevent path traversal attacks.
    \item \textbf{Stable Project Hashing}: Replaced \texttt{std::hash} with a deterministic FNV-1a mixing algorithm to ensure consistent project IDs and prevent environment collisions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Architectural Refinements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Recursive Cleanup}: The \texttt{uninstall} and \texttt{prune} logic now recursively removes empty parent directories, ensuring zero bloat.
    \item \textbf{Cross-Platform Portability}: Native dependency tracing in \texttt{trim} now supports both \texttt{otool} (Mac) and \texttt{ldd} (Linux).
    \item \textbf{Hardened JSON Parsing}: Metadata extraction now uses non-greedy, targeted regular expressions to eliminate ReDoS risk.
    \item \textbf{Dependency Intelligence}: Improved \texttt{requires\_dist} parsing for better handling of versioned constraints and platform markers.
\end{itemize}

\section{Verification}
The tool has been self-audited using \texttt{spip review} and verified to be safe and robust against common environment drift and security vulnerabilities.
