\section{Introduction}
Current Python package management using \texttt{pip} and \texttt{venv} suffers from environment drift, lack of versioning, and hidden security risks. \texttt{spip} introduces a pure implementation that provides deep dependency analysis, automatic repair/verification, deterministic housekeeping, and advanced AI-driven code review.

\section{The spip Architecture}
\texttt{spip} addresses these via a novel architecture combining:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Centralized Vault}: All environments are stored in \texttt{\~{}/.spip/envs/}.
    \item \textbf{Git-as-Database}: A central Git repository tracks all environment states.
    \item \textbf{AI Code Review}: The \texttt{spip review} command leverages the \textbf{Gemini Pro API} to perform a deep architectural and safety review of the entire project source. It identifies complex logical bugs, security vulnerabilities, and design anti-patterns.
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Security Auditing}: The \texttt{spip audit} command performs a batch query of all installed libraries against the **OSV (Open Source Vulnerability) database**.
    \item \textbf{Orphan Pruning}: Recursive graph traversal to identify and remove unused sub-dependencies.
    \item \textbf{Environment Portability (Freeze)}: Bundles the entire environment into a compressed \texttt{.tgz} archive.
    \item \textbf{Bulk Environment Testing}: Automated discovery and execution of package internal tests.
    \item \textbf{Self-Healing Verification}: Automated patching of legacy syntax ambiguities.
    \item \textbf{Atomic Commits and Rollbacks}: Every change is an atomic Git commit.
\end{itemize}

\section{Formal Verification}
The isolation, auditing, and maintenance strategies have been formally verified in Coq (\texttt{safety.v}), proving that the environment lifecycle maintains strict projection on the user's branch and preserves global system state.

\section{Implementation}
\texttt{spip} is implemented in C++23. It integrates with native system tools and advanced static analysis to provide a robust, version-controlled, and secure Python development experience.
