\section{Introduction}
Current Python package management using \texttt{pip} and \texttt{venv} suffers from environment drift and a lack of primitive versioning. \texttt{spip} introduces a pure implementation that bypasses \texttt{pip} architecture entirely and provides a rich, informative user interface and deep dependency analysis.

\section{The spip Architecture}
\texttt{spip} addresses these via a novel architecture combining:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Centralized Vault}: All environments are stored in \texttt{\~{}/.spip/envs/}, identified by project hashes.
    \item \textbf{Git-as-Database}: A central Git repository (\texttt{\~{}/.spip/repo}) tracks all environment states.
    \item \textbf{Custom Installer}: Bypasses \texttt{pip} by implementing a recursive dependency resolver and a wheel-based installation engine directly in C++23.
    \item \textbf{Dependency Tree Analysis}: Built-in command (\texttt{spip tree}) to visualize complex sub-dependency hierarchies recursively.
    \item \textbf{Interactive UI}: Real-time progress bars for both individual package downloads and global installation progress.
    \item \textbf{Deterministic Uninstaller}: Precisely removes packages by parsing the \texttt{RECORD} metadata file.
    \item \textbf{Local Registry (DB)}: A partitioned, versioned Git repository in \texttt{\~{}/.spip/db/} containing metadata for 730,000+ packages.
    \item \textbf{Atomic Commits}: Every single package extraction or removal is an atomic Git commit.
\end{itemize}

\section{Formal Verification}
The isolation strategy has been formally verified in Coq (\texttt{safety.v}), proving that recursive dependency installation only ever targets the local user branch and never contaminates the global system state.

\section{Implementation}
\texttt{spip} is implemented in high-performance C++23. It utilizes multi-threading for the registry crawler and advanced shell escaping for risk-free command execution.
